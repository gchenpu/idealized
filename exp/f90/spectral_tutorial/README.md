## Tutorial for spectral transforms on the sphere 
A tutorial for transforms_mod, a module for the transformation of grid fields defined on the sphere to spherical harmonics, and manipulations within the spherical harmonic representation. Run the program and study the output and the program simultaneously.  Also, compare your output to the one that we generate with this Program (fms.out)

## Summary of directory contents

- namelists: namelist parameters
- fms.out:   sample output
